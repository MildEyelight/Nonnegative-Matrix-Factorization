# Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization
THIS PROJECT REMAIN UNFINISHED

I have read an article about Community Dectection[1] on Graph which includes a method called nonegative matrix factorization(NMF), 
And I began to read the related article about NMF and its variant Deep NMF.
This Flie use to stores the code I have written while reading these articles about these NMF variants.
The plan is as follows:/n
------PLAN------
1.NMF baseline
2.Deep NMF(Multilayer NMF)
3.Deep sparse NMF
4.Deep orthogonal NMF
5.Deep non-smooth NMF
----------------

NMF has a lot of application in Representation Learning, Clustering Algorithm.
In representation learning, I will use image data to extract the feature of image set and also use graph data to do so. It's a good way to do dimension reduction.
Benefit by it ability to understand the component of object, NMF can give us a new understanding of how to feature a data.
Also in clustering algorithm, the orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization has been proved equality with K-means, and I will also search the meaning by implement these.
